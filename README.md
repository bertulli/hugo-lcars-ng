# LCARS-NG (Next Generation)

## Features
**LCARS-NG** is a Hugo theme inspired by the LCARS operating system from the Star Trek franchise (© CBS Television Studios), since _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ (TNG) onward. I want to clearly say it is an **unofficial** homage, not related with the propriety, intellectual or commercial, of the Star Trek franchise.

For now, it features a simple sidebar inspired by the "_okudagram_" look and feel.

## Installation

Simply clone the repository inside your Hugo project, under `<project-root>/themes/`, and point the theme in your `hugo.toml` like
```toml
theme = 'hugo-lcars-ng'
```

## Configuration
This is still a very alpha level project. For now, you can directly modify the `lcars-ng/assets/css/main.css` file.

## A note about the license
The project is licensed with the [**GPLv3**](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) (see the [`COPYING`](./COPYING) file). It may be relicensed in the future with a more permissive free license. I wanted it to be free software because I want it to contribute to the common work of the human race, and I'd like this effort will pass and grow along the people who will enjoy it. I intend here with the GPLv3 redistribution clause that you can use the theme for any Hugo site you want, even for closed content, but if you distribute the site with the theme and modify it, you need to use the GPLv3 license too. If it were up to me, I would also add the [Hippocratic License](https://firstdonoharm.dev/) or the simple belief that ["software shall be used for good, not evil"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford), but this technically is incompatible with the free licenses. Please, if you use this, do your best to uphold this additional principle.

## Credits
The theme is mainly developed by Alessandro Bertulli ([Ensign's Blog](https://www.ensignsblog.net)), but inspiration was taken by all the other extremely cool themes at theme Star Trek present out there. Among the others, I can cite:

+ [TheLCARS.com](https://www.thelcars.com) developed by Jim Robertus. The theme is pure HTML+CSS, not directly usable by Hugo, and has a custom license. The theme is very complete, but I wanted to make it a little simpler, and under a free license, so I took inspiration for the potentialities of pure CSS.
+ [LCARS by Jörn Weißenborn](https://github.com/joernweissenborn/lcars) simpler, but advanced CSS theme.
+ [HTMLCARS](https://xiphoseer.de/htmlcars/) by Daniel G. Seiler (Xiphoseer).
+ [GTJ LCARS](https://www.gtjlcars.de) by D. Kerner (actually little used for now).

Special mentions: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, for the initial kickstart. Yeah, I'm not happy either with the proliferation of AI slop out there, but I have to admit it proved useful (the Pro model at least) for the initial structure. Successive addition were made with the traditional 🍃Organic programming®🌈. When in doubt on some minor things, I used ChatGPT to summarise some parts of the documentations and/or provide examples. Technically, since AI models swallow up the entire internet, I guess this means **credit goes to every programmer out there who has ever published on the web. I see you friend. Thank you.**

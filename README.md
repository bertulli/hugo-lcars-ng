# LCARS-NG (Next Generation)

## Features
**LCARS-NG** is a Hugo theme inspired by the LCARS operating system from the Star Trek franchise (© CBS Television Studios), since _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ (TNG) onward. I want to clearly say it is an **unofficial** homage, not related with the propriety, intellectual or commercial, of the Star Trek franchise.

For now, it features a simple sidebar inspired by the "_okudagram_" look and feel.

## Installation

Simply clone the repository inside your Hugo project, under `<project-root>/themes/`, and point the theme in your `hugo.toml` like
```toml
theme = 'hugo-lcars-ng'
```

## Configuration
This is still a very alpha level project. For now, you can directly modify the `lcars-ng/assets/css/main.css` file.

## Credits
The theme is mainly developed by Alessandro Bertulli ([Ensign's Blog](https://www.ensignsblog.net)), but inspiration was taken by all the other extremely cool themes at theme Star Trek present out there. Among the others, I can cite:

+ [TheLCARS.com](https://www.thelcars.com) developed by Jim Robertus. The theme is pure HTML+CSS, not directly usable by Hugo, and has a custom license. The theme is very complete, but I wanted to make it a little simpler, and under a free license, so I took inspiration for the potentialities of pure CSS.
+ [LCARS by Jörn Weißenborn](https://github.com/joernweissenborn/lcars) simpler, but advanced CSS theme.
+ [HTMLCARS](https://xiphoseer.de/htmlcars/) by Daniel G. Seiler (Xiphoseer).
+ [GTJ LCARS](https://www.gtjlcars.de) by D. Kerner (actually little used for now).

Special mentions: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, for the initial kickstart. Yeah, I'm not happy either with the proliferation of AI slop out there, but I have to admit it proved useful (the Pro model at least) for the initial structure. Successive addition were made with the traditional 🍃Organic programming®🌈. When in doubt on some minor things, I used ChatGPT to summarise some parts of the documentations and/or provide examples. Technically, since AI models swallow up the entire internet, I guess this means **credit goes to every programmer out there who has ever published on the web. I see you friend. Thank you.**
